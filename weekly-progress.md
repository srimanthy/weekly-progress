What I’ve Studied So Far

Linux fundamentals:
– Navigating the filesystem, managing users/groups, permissions
– Installing packages; troubleshooting services and kernel issues

Shell scripting:
– Writing reusable Bash scripts (loops, conditionals, functions)
– Parsing text, handling arguments, automating routine tasks

Version control:
– Git & GitHub: cloning/forking repositories, branching, commits, merging, pull requests

AWS basics:
– AWS CLI: installing/configuring (aws configure), scripting EC2, S3, VPC operations
– EC2: launching instances, choosing AMIs, key-pair SSH auth
– VPC: designing subnets, route tables, security groups, network ACLs
– S3: creating buckets, setting policies, lifecycle rules

Current Focus

Ansible:
– Control-node setup; managed-host configuration
– Writing playbooks for software install & configuration

Terraform:
– CLI setup; provider initialization
– Basic HCL to provision EC2, VPC, S3

Next Steps

CI/CD pipelines
– Choose a tool (e.g. GitHub Actions or Jenkins)
– Automate testing, linting and deployment of your IaC and application code

Docker containerization
– Write Dockerfiles and build images for your apps/services
– Run, tag and push containers to a registry (e.g. Docker Hub, ECR)

Kubernetes orchestration
– Deploy a local or managed cluster (e.g. k3s, EKS)
– Define Deployments, Services and ConfigMaps to run your containers at scale

IaC & config integration
– Use Terraform modules to provision Kubernetes resources
– Use Ansible to manage in-cluster configuration and secrets
